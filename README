Introduction
------------

rgxg (ReGular eXpression Generator) is a C library and a command-line tool
to generate (extended) regular expressions.

The homepage of rgxg is <https://rgxg.github.io>.


License

rgxg is licensed under the zlib/libpng license. See the COPYING file for
details.


Getting source
--------------

rgxg is currently maintained on GitHub. Please visit
https://github.com/rgxg/rgxg/ to get the newest version of the
source code.


Source Code Verification
------------------------

It is recommended to check that the source code of rgxg downloaded is an
original and unmodified one. You can either verify the source tarball or the
git tag.

To check the supplied signature with GnuPG:

  gpg --verify rgxg-<VERSION_NUMBER>.tar.gz.asc

This checks that the detached signature file is indeed a valid signature
of rgxg-<VERSION_NUMBER>.tar.gz.

To validate the gpg signature of a git tag:

  git verify-tag v<VERSION_NUMBER>

The public key needed for signature verification is:

    pub   rsa4096/0xF6947DAB68E7B931 2011-06-28 [C] [expires: 2023-06-27]
    uid                  Hannes von Haugwitz <hannes@vonhaugwitz.com>

If you do not have this key, you can get from one of the well known PGP key
servers. You have to make sure that the key you install is not a faked one. You
can do this with reasonable assurance by comparing the output of:

  gpg --fingerprint 0xF6947DAB68E7B931

with the key fingerprint published elsewhere.

Build requirements:
-------------------
    * autoconf (when building from git)
    * automake (when building from git)
    * libtool (when building from git)
    * make
    * C-compiler (such as gcc)

Installation
------------

If you are using a git version of the source you need to generate the
configuration files first:

    $ sh ./autogen.sh

NOTE: The library version (see m4/lib_version.m4) is only changed if needed
      just before a stable release.

For generic installation instructions please see the INSTALL file (generated
by autogen.sh).

In short, just type:
    $ ./configure
    $ make
    $ make install

See './configure --help' for the available configuration options.
